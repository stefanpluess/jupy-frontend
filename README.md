# jupy-frontend
The Frontend Repository for the Jupyter-Canvas

![Jupy](/public/jupy.jpg)


This project transforms Jupyter notebooks to overcome their limitations:
- **Unlimited space**: interact with Jupyter on a 2D-Canvas.

- **Dynamic Branching**: branch as much as you want, each branch becomes a new virtual notebook.

- **Flexible Cells**: create unlimited cells within each branch.

- **Bubble Groups**: organize content in bubbles, connected through edges.

- **Effortless Updates**: changes in parent bubbles propagate to child bubbles.

- **Isolated Siblings**: sibling bubbles work independently.

Experience unparalleled flexibility, organization and productivity in the future of notebooks. 
Welcome to a new era of data exploration and code development!


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To run the project locally, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

1. Clone the repository and install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Jupyter-Canvas/jupy-frontend
    cd jupy-frontend
    npm install
    ```
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following line:
    ```bash
    REACT_APP_API_TOKEN=
    ```
    This will tell the frontend which token to use to authenticate with the backend.

## üíª Usage
To start the application, run the following command:
```bash
npm run start-set-token
```
You will be asked to enter the token from the backend.
This will set the token in the `.env` file and start the project.

If you want to use the application with Safari, then you are good to go. 
If you want to use it with Chrome you need to disable the same origin policy.
